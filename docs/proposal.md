# Cyber Risk Copilot
CSCI 7200 – Master’s Project

## 1. Problem Statement
Small and medium-sized organizations (SMEs) face significant cybersecurity risk but often lack the expertise, staffing, and budget required to operationalize comprehensive security frameworks such as the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) and the CIS Critical Security Controls (v8). These frameworks are typically high-level and difficult for resource-constrained organizations to translate into clear, prioritized security actions. As a result, SMEs frequently struggle to determine which cybersecurity controls to implement first, leading to inefficient use of limited resources and increased exposure to preventable threats.

## 2. Project Objective
The objective of this project is to design and evaluate a simple cyber risk decision-support framework, that assists small and medium-sized enterprises in prioritizing cybersecurity actions based on their organizational characteristics, threat exposure, and operational context. The project focuses on producing transparent and explainable prioritization logic rather than implementing a full production system.

## 3. Scope and Focus
This project focuses on the design of a structured risk assessment and prioritization model rather than the development of a full cybersecurity platform. The scope includes defining model inputs, risk scoring logic, and prioritized outputs aligned with established cybersecurity standards. The project explicitly excludes large-scale system deployment, advanced machine learning model training, and real-time threat detection.

## 4. Technical Contribution
The primary technical contribution of this project is the design of a rule-based decision model that maps organizational attributes and exposure factors to a ranked set of cybersecurity actions. The model incorporates factors such as organization size, data sensitivity, access patterns, and threat exposure to generate phased recommendations. The framework is grounded in the NIST CSF and CIS Controls and emphasizes transparency, explainability, and practicality for SMEs.

## 5. Methodology
The project will proceed in four stages:
1. Review and analysis of existing cybersecurity frameworks and SME-focused risk assessment approaches.
2. Definition of model inputs and decision logic for risk scoring and prioritization.
3. Implementation of the decision model in Python.
4. Evaluation of the framework using representative SME scenarios to assess clarity, feasibility, and alignment with best practices.

## 6. Evaluation Approach
The framework will be evaluated using multiple hypothetical but realistic SME scenarios representing different industries and risk profiles. For each scenario, the model’s prioritized recommendations will be analyzed to determine whether they align with established cybersecurity guidance and practical expectations for organizations struggling with resources.

## 7. Expected Deliverables
- A documented cyber risk prioritization framework.
- A Python-based implementation of the decision model.
- Scenario-based evaluation results and analysis.
- Recommendations for future enhancements, including potential decision-support automation.
